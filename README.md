# bungalow_test
QA challenge for Bungalow Interview. Using cypher for front-end testing of http://test-challenge.bungalow.com/polls/

The scope and the functionalities of the application are quite limited. I have still added a number of tests in my test plan. It is, by no means, an exhaustive test plan. There are many things we can add in there. e.g. responsiveness tests, keyboard interaction tests, performance tests, verification of HTTP responses and many more aspects of testing.

What I want to illustrate in the example tests I am writing here is that I can take an unfamiliar framework, learn it in a short time to be an effective tester and subsequently hone my skills to provide effective test coverage.
